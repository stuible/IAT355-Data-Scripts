At the age of 17, Mercury and his family fled from Zanzibar for safety reasons due to the 1964 [[Zanzibar Revolution]],<ref name = "Januszczak_1996"/> in which thousands of Arabs and Indians were killed.<ref>{{Harvnb|Plekhanov|2004|p=91}}</ref> The family moved into a small house at 22 Gladstone Avenue, [[Feltham]], [[Middlesex]], England. Mercury enrolled at [[Isleworth]] Polytechnic (now [[West Thames College]]) in [[West (London sub region)|West London]] where he studied art. He ultimately earned a diploma in Art and Graphic Design at [[Ealing Art College]] (now the Ealing campus of [[University of West London]]), later using these skills to design the Queen heraldic arms. A British citizen at birth, Mercury remained so for the rest of his life.<ref name="Jones_1998" >{{harvnb|Jones|1998}}.</ref>

Following graduation, Mercury joined a series of bands and sold second-hand clothes in the [[Kensington Market, London|Kensington Market]] in London with girlfriend Mary Austin. He also held a job at [[Heathrow Airport]]. Friends from the time remember him as a quiet and shy young man who showed a great deal of interest in music.<ref name=student>{{harvnb|Davis|1996|pp=1,10}}</ref> In 1969 he joined the [[Liverpool]]-based band Ibex, later renamed Wreckage.

In April 1970 Mercury joined guitarist [[Brian May]] and drummer [[Roger Taylor (Queen drummer)|Roger Taylor]] who had previously been in a band called [[Smile (band)|Smile]]. In 1971 they were joined by bassist [[John Deacon]]. Despite reservations of the other members and [[Trident Studios]], the band's initial management, Mercury chose the name "Queen" for the new band. He later said, "It's very regal obviously, and it sounds splendid. It's a strong name, very universal and immediate. I was certainly aware of the gay connotations, but that was just one facet of it."<ref name="Highleyman_2005">{{harvnb|Highleyman|2005}}.</ref> At about the same time, he changed his surname, Bulsara, to Mercury.<ref>{{harvnb|SutcliffeHinceMack|2009|p=22}}</ref> Mercury designed Queen's logo, called the Queen crest, shortly before the release of the band's first album.<ref name="LOGO"/> The logo combines the [[zodiac]] signs of all four members: two lions for [[Leo (astrology)|Leo]] (Deacon and Taylor), a crab for [[Cancer (astrology)|Cancer]] (May), and two fairies for [[Virgo (astrology)|Virgo]] (Mercury).<ref name="LOGO"/> The lions embrace a stylised letter Q, the crab rests atop the letter with flames rising directly above it, and the fairies are each sheltering below a lion.<ref name="LOGO"/> There is also a crown inside the Q and the whole logo is over-shadowed by an enormous [[phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]].
