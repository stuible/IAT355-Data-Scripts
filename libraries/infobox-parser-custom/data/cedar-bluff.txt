'''Cedar Bluff State Park''' is a public recreation area located {{convert|21|mi}} southeast of [[WaKeeney, Kansas|WaKeeney]] and {{convert|23|mi}} southwest of [[Ellis, Kansas|Ellis]] in [[Trego County, Kansas|Trego County]], [[Kansas]], [[United States]].

The [[state park]] is divided into two areas, comprising {{convert|850|acre|ha}}, straddling the {{convert|6800|acre|ha|adj=on}} [[Cedar Bluff Reservoir]]. The Bluffton Area—{{convert|300|acre|ha}} on the north shore—is the most developed and receives extensive use. The Page Creek Area—{{convert|500|acre|ha}} on the south shore—offers primitive camping as well as 36 utility sites.<ref name=kdwpt/> West of the Page Creek Area are the [[juniper]]-lined, {{convert|100|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} [[limestone]] [[Hill|bluffs]] from which the reservoir's name was derived (junipers were often misidentified as "cedars" by early settlers).

Threshing Machine Canyon, the site of an 1850s Native American attack on a wagon train bearing a [[threshing machine]], is accessed by a road west of the park. In the historic [[canyon]] one can find carvings dating back to the mid-19th century.<ref name=kstourism/>
