'''ACF Fiorentina [[Società per azioni|S.p.A.]]''',<ref name="fiorentina_society" /><ref name="fiorentina_society_legacalcio" /> commonly referred to as simply '''Fiorentina''' {{IPA-it|fjorenˈtiːna|}}, is a professional [[Football in Italy|Italian football]] club from [[Florence]], Tuscany. Founded by a merger in 1926, and refounded in 2002 following bankruptcy, Fiorentina have played at the top level of Italian football for the majority of their existence; only four clubs have played in more [[Serie A]] seasons.

Fiorentina has won two [[List of Italian football champions|Italian Championships]], in [[1955–56 Serie A|1955–56]] and again in [[1968–69 Serie A|1968–69]], as well as six [[Coppa Italia]] trophies and one [[Supercoppa Italiana]]. On the [[UEFA|European stage]], Fiorentina won the [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup]] in [[1960–61 European Cup Winners' Cup|1960–61]] and lost the final one year later. They finished runners-up in the [[1956–57 European Cup]], losing against [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]], and also came close to winning the [[1989–90 UEFA Cup]], finishing as runners-up against [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] after losing the first leg in [[Turin]] and drawing in the second one in [[Avellino]].

Fiorentina is one of the thirteen European teams that played the finals in all three major continental competitions: the Champions League (1956–1957, the first Italian team to reach the final in the top continental competition), the UEFA Cup Winners (1960–1961 and 1961–1962) and the UEFA Cup (1989–1990).

Since 1931, the club have played at the [[Stadio Artemio Franchi]], which currently has a capacity of 43,147. The stadium has used several names over the years and has undergone several renovations. Fiorentina are known widely by the nickname ''Viola'', a reference to their distinctive purple colours.
